Jesus hasn\\'t said dick since. \\n\\nHe also didn\\'t threaten to bomb his oppressors. And don\\'t give me that \"Well, actually, the technology back then--\" No, shut it. He was Jesus. If he wanted to build a bomb so big he couldn\\'t even lift it, well... actually theologists still wrestle with that one.\\n\\nLook, I was raised Catholic. I know the hypocrisy, the loopholes, the double standards braided throughout that weird scene. Hell, most of them vote for Trump because he\\'s \"pro-life\". In what world?\\n\\nSeriously, religious people -- you\\'ve got a voice. You really want Trump riding on Jesus\\' coattails? Given the church\\'s PR problems over the past several years, speaking up could be your one shot at redemption. Otherwise it\\'s \"The church? Oh yeah. Child molestation *and* fascism.

But the whole reason for these protests are because of police overreach and brutality. Where the guard is deployed, I'm not seeing videos of guardsmen pepper spraying medics and shooting journalists. But I am seeing the police do that. I dont know if leaving it to the police to quell rioting over police brutality is the right move either. At least the military has some discipline. I'm kinda starting to think that the military in this situation is almost more pointed towards the police, at least in so much as stopping the rioting with less brutality and bs that the cops themselves are causing. \\n\\nIdk. This I think is a much tougher choice or decision than it appears on the surface. Things could go really wrong here, but civil law enforcement is not only not getting the job done, but actually making things worse. I've known alot of stupid chucklef*cks that have served, but at this point I still trust the military to be more disciplined and restrained than the police at this point. \\n\\nScary times.\")],\n",

We\\'d served together in the National Guard back in the late 90s to early 00s, when I separated. Then, in 2007, I unexpectedly ran into him at a neighborhood party, he was there with a friend of a friend.\\n\\nI\\'ll preface this with the fact that I\\'m going off of memory of a conversation I had 13 years ago regarding events that occurred 15 years ago. Some details may be fuzzy or wrong and I have no way of verifying since I haven\\'t seen him in many years. \\n\\nAnyway, he\\'d been deployed to New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina. He was assigned a group of guys who\\'d returned from Afghanistan or Iraq and was sent into a neighborhood to provide support to local law enforcement. The way he told it, he was looking to have a conversation with whomever was in charge on the ground and essentially went looking for them. He found them at some residence and, not thinking anything of it, left his guys in the street and started for the front door of the residence. As he was crossing the front yard, the cops step out with a bunch of shit they\\'d taken from the abandoned house. Pretty sure he said one of them was carrying a TV, some shit like that. \\n\\nHe said it was a deer in the headlights moment where the cops clearly hadn\\'t expected him. There were words exchanged, I think he\\'d told them to put the shit back or something similar. They didn\\'t appreciate being ordered around in their own city and fucking drew down on him. I don\\'t remember if it was one cop or more.\\n\\nBut, obviously, his guys were behind him and they reacted immediately, turning it into a little stand off. He basically told them: Shoot me and my guys will drop all of you. You\\'re going to lose.\\n\\nThe cops relented and dropped their shit. Unfortunately, I don\\'t remember anything else. I have no idea what happened afterward. I got the sense it was a fucked up situation and he basically took the \"I\\'ll do my job while I\\'m here but can\\'t do anything about what I don\\'t see\" approach.')],\n",

Take a look at /r/2020PoliceBrutality if you think im kidding. Or better yet see on the news how even reporters are getting hurt for no reason. But yeah just blame the looters for destorying the cause.\\n\\nThe looters are a reuslt of a much greater problem, by focusing on the tip of the iceberg YOU are doing irreparable damage to the cause. \\n\\nIf looting fucking bothers you so much go out and protest peacefully and HELP THE CAUSE AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY AND DONATE TO YOUR COMMUNITES THAT HAVE BEEN HURT. \\n\\nCreate meaningful change for your society where everyone gets treated equally and you won't have riots. This isn't a threat from black people, this is understanding how society works. You can't just step on ANY group for this long, and even condemn them for the peaceful protests THEY DID DO(see Colin Kaeperinick) and then just sit back and expect them to play by your rules for 500th time and still get killed at the end regardless of wheter they follow them or not. \\n\\nTo those that say looting has ruined the cause I question what your values were in the first place. Black people do not get a fair shake in this society they have no reason to NOT LOOT anymore, because even if they fucking don't loot, they'll still get shot like dogs on the street in America. You need to protect all people in this society or you will get more riots thats not a question of if, its when. \\n\\nI want the looting to stop too, minorities and small business are getting hurt. I want there to not be an event like this again. But if the police and America still won't hold themselves accountable for the murders they have commited you can damn sure expect there are going to be more riots in your lifetime. \\nI'm peacefully protesting, supporting justice and donating to my local communities as they recover. I want the police to protect and serve so that we don't end up here as a society agian. \\n\\nPlease, people get it right: \\nTHE POLICE HAVE DONE IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO THIS SOCIETY.\\n\\nEDIT: How many non flairs are on this sub now? It's so obvious most of these accounts are kids from the burbs.\\n\\nBring on the downvotes.

I\\'ve had similar relationships with my guy friends at work, and I know she had them with her girl friends. \\n\\nI\\'ve got a very good friend(m) of mine who I would call \"babe,\" \"cherry,\" \"pretty lady\" and others in addition to things like \"piece of garbage,\" \"stupid,\" and \"fuckface.\" \\n\\nAnd I\\'m aware that she, like me, had friends of the opposite gender who called her names. My guy friends and I love giving each other affection. Yes, they will absolutely roast me when it\\'s well deserved. But I know whenever I\\'d have a bad day or came in looking like shit they didn\\'t hesitate to call me sweetie, give me a hug and listen. I\\'ve had women friends who did the same. And I know it was the same for my wife. \\n\\nI know that she got compliments on great outfits from her friends. Sometimes you get flirty with your friends, but it\\'s sarcastic and meaningless because everyone involved KNOWS it\\'s not going anywhere because no one involved wants that to happen. Boundaries, respect, and trust. And if ever they transitioned to full time friend, when we\\'d all hang out jointly, it was as friends. We just were playful and cute and mean, but always respectful. \\n\\nI wanted her to have friends that cared deeply about her. I trust my wife and she\\'s a really cool person, so the people she\\'s friends with are probably cool too. Why would I want to come between her and people with whom she could have a lot of fun or learn or share fantastical things? I love this woman and I want her to be happy and have close friendships to have a life worth living.\\n\\nEmails: In no way does anyone want someone to send them a bunch of hearts in a company email.

Which can impact his job, so going offline for any kind of personal issue sounds about right. It\\'s really dumb that happened.\\n\\nI\\'m not trying to give him defense or judge either of you. I do not know the context of these messages, names, hugs, or anything nor is it my business. I\\'m simply providing my experience of it not being exactly what many here are saying. \\n\\nHe may very well be doing the things they\\'re stating. Only you can know that, and to do that you\\'ll have to figure out how to talk to him. Why didn\\'t he tell you more about how close they were before?  Or being open about as the friendship develops. I want to know what cool thing they did so I can feel that happiness with them. Because we don\\'t like the exact same things.

For you, this could mean finding a tv show that you only watch while working out, finding a podcast that you only listen to while working out or coming up with a reward system for yourself so, if you stay on track, you treat yourself.\\n\\nIt might also take a bit of experimentation to find a style of working out that works for you.  I started off 6-7 years ago with running, then HIIT, then weights, and I finally settled on pilates/yoga, which I've been pretty consistent with for 4 years now.  The best workout is the one you'll actually *do.*  But don't forget that, if your goal is weight loss, your diet is going to determine 90% of your results.  I know you probably don't want to hear that, but it's unfortunately *very* difficult to outwork a bad diet.\"),\n",

Trauma actually causes brain damage, which can result in long-lasting memory problems, even if you are not currently being abused. I think too that our brains block things as a defense mechanism.\\n\\nI didn't have a particularly traumatic childhood but my teenage years and my 20s are largely blank spots due to other kinds of abuse. My mother remembers stuff that happened to me, things that I can't remember at all. I will ask her to tell me things so I can fill in the blanks of my own life. It is really weird when someone else remembers more of your life than you do.\\n\\nThe vast majority of people do not remember their dreams. In a way, dreams are not meant to be something you carry into the conscious world. It is common in people with PTSD to have horrible vivid nightmares where they remember every detail. This is something I suffer with often. But do not worry about not remembering your dreams; it is normal.\\n\\nRemembering what happened to you is important if you want to heal. Afterall, it is difficult to come to terms with something if you can't remember it, right? The only advice I have would be to seek out a therapist who specializes in trauma. They may have some techniques to help you uncover things, and they will be there for you if you do remember something that is difficult to deal with and makes you feel unsafe. I wouldn't try to recover memories when you are alone in case it is overwhelming.\\n\\nBe kind to yourself and try not to feel ashamed of your memory problems.

Seems absolutely crazy to me that no one has ever taken a picture there past 11pm to prove otherwise, and if they have idk where they are lol.\\n\\nLike I said to you in another comment (I think), we will ultimately see very quickly whether or not this is a nightly thing now that it's been pointed out. If we're wrong then were wrong, but if trump or any supporters were lying they're going to have to keep this lie going forever now which I find sorta amusing. \\n\\nPeople have nothing to lose by stating otherwise.

       "   '\"I cannot begin to express enough my utter disappointment in you, Police Chief Moore. The words you used yesterday are not words that were hidden somewhere behind the wall. They are words you intentionally used and prepared for. That disappointment is why I called. That, along with your actions throughout this protest, are why we call for your resignation. I urge you to make history in California. Don\\'t leave this sour taste in your citizens\\' mouths. We are advocating for people. We\\'re advocating for lives that matter. We\\'re advocating for safety of the citizens. I, as a property owner in California, am disappointed to hear how my tax dollars are being spent. We need to coincide with People\\'s Budget LA and understand where our money is going for. You are making history, Chief Moore, and this is the scene you are leaving in Los Angeles. I hope you can live with that.\" - Isabella\\n\\n\"A lot of people reflected on Chief Moore\\'s comments. They weren\\'t stupid; they reflected what you believe. And while that\\'s alarming, that\\'s not surprising. The entire US police system has roots in the slave-catcher/over-seer roles from the plantation and from slavery. The entire system is filled with racist officers from the top down. We have witnessed multiple videos over the week of cops excited and turned on by the opportunity to hurt folks and exert their power. You all constantly patrol and taunt black and poor communities. You are power hungry and you feel threatened in this moment by our collective power. Who are you serving? I don\\'t want to see anymore black faces up in this system. I want this whole system gone. We need justice, not order. So if you want to quote Martin Luther King, please read all of his history and understand that we must abolish this system, we must abolish the police, and you all need to take responsibility.\" - Chantelle W.\\n\\n\"First off, obviously, Chief Moore, you need to go. Second off, I\\'m a black woman, I am a mother of a black son, and my husband is a police officer. I am scared every day for him to go to work because of this fucked up culture that law enforcement leadership like Officer Moore has created. I want you to know that I am fully dedicated to eradicating the kind of flaccid and inane leadership that we have seen from local government and law enforcement for a very long time, but even more so in the recent days. I am a law student and a future law-maker and I am fully committed to that. Second off, remember George Floyd, okay? Remember Officer Chauvin\\'s knee on his neck. That is how I am going to have knee on your neck until leaders like you are powerless and are not leading this system anymore.\" - Alexandra V.H.\\n\\n\"I\\'d like to take a moment to acknowledge that not a single person before me has had any praise for a single action your disgraceful leadership has made during this time. This should speak volumes alone. There are nearly 20,000 people watching this meeting and we\\'re all going to hold you accountable. The excessive force being used during these protests is deplorable. Turning them into riots puts blood on your hands, not on ours. I echo the belief that Police Chief Moore should be fired immediately. It is unbelievably disrespectful that Mayor Garcetti is not present for this meeting. Your commission has failed us time and time again, and where the fuck is our citizen oversight? We don\\'t approve of this. Start standing up to the people oppressing human rights or get out of our way. The US Declaration of Independence states that, in layman\\'s terms, we have a right, nay the duty, to overthrow government that acts against our common interest and threatens the safety without cause. Defund the police, support our community, or we\\'ll remove you from office.\" - Caller 4032\\n\\n\"I am a nurse in Los Angeles.

But never have I ever seen nurses \\\\[?\\\\] or decide to kill or end the lives of the sick. This is my oath as a nurse, to keep all people alive.

I will not sit here as nurses are putting their lives at risk during COVID-19, and you\\'re using my tax dollars to abuse the system. You must take responsibility.

You specified how many officers been injured, you have facts on that, you have numbers on that, but you do not have numbers for how many citizens, how many protestors were hurt or killed. Those numbers are not as important to you. Your job is to defend the people above the police, and that is not happening. This is not about specific cops. This is about an entire system. There are some jobs which do not have a margin for error and this is one of them. The public does not want your narrative. They are not asking for that. They are asking for you to hear theirs.

       "   '\"I am resident of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County my entire life. And even though I have never been a fan of the police, I never believed in the police abolition movement until this Saturday when I saw with my very own eyes just how egregiously the police were behaving at the protest. My friend Brandon gave a comment earlier about being shot at. That was us. We were there together, walking there together walking peacefully on the streets of Echo Park and Chinatown border when cop cars started swerving toward people who were walking on the street, driving nearly 70 miles an hour and nearly hitting them, then going to freeway and charging at us as if we were in a war zone. And then shooting in our direction at just people walking and yelling. And I had seen all these reports of people saying that they weren\\'t violent and that the police had started everything. And even me, a very liberal person said, well that\\'s ridiculous. There\\'s no way the police are completely at fault here. And I saw for it with my very own eyes that day that they were. That people were just trying to exercise their first amendment right to protest and peacefully gather, and the cops acted out of a sense of revenge, out of resentment of us speaking our minds about how they treat people in this country, most of all black people. It\\'s absolutely disgusting. And I\\'m telling you right now that if you don\\'t take radical steps to reform the police, you\\'re going to radicalize a lot more people like me, who were on your side before, didn\\'t want to get rid of the police, and now say fuck you all. Thank you.\" - Jessica P.\\n\\n\"I\\'m a journalist and recent graduate of USC. I\\'ve spent close to one year being a cop reporter in LA. My experiences have brought me close contact with multiple divisions of the LAPD and I\\'ve even gone on ride-alongs to deepen my reporting. The common answer LAPD officers gave me was that the press gets it wrong most of the time. They\\'ve aired their grievances of how they only show the negative side of cops and never the good side. But journalism means to hold power to account. It is not PR. It is our duty to hold you to account when you fail at yours, which is to protect and serve the people. While there are instances when the media is incorrect, the number of times where police forces get violent and racial tensions are too high to be dismissed as a fluke. What are your thoughts as of now? Are you still going to maintain that the LAPD and other police forces do not create systems of oppression that harm minorities? - Bulbul R.\\n\\n\"Chief Moore, you should have not walked back what you said yesterday. It was your truth. You believed what you said, and that\\'s because yours is the most murderous police force in the land. Having said that, keep George Floyd out of your mouth. You have a list of 600 bodies that have been looted from their families from your peacekeepers. Yet, you want to talk about Big Floyd. You and DA Jackie Lacey both need to exit stage left. Your cops are out there, removing their name tags from their uniform and taping or blanking out their names on their helmet. Your thugs are out there laughing at protestors and shooting rubber bullets directly at protestors, including my friends.\" - Emily B.\\n\\n\"Everyone who spoke today from the police department and the city said how much they want to hear from the black community. As a black queer woman, I want to say that this community, our community, my community is not oppressed because we haven\\'t said anything. Words mean things. Conflating protestors with looters, equating peaceful protestors with officers who lynch George Floyd on camera is just another attempt to shift responsibility and blame a community that is lashing out because we\\'ve been given no other recourse. Black people have been in a constant state of terror and grief and mourning by this police department, police departments across the country, long before these protests started. We\\'ve heard your responses and they are hollow. We\\'re not asking for too much. We simply want police to stop killing us and be accountable when they do. Police, the government, and white supremacy have been looting black bodies on a scale that has never been  addressed in any meaningful way. And now you want to demonize us over a couple of cop cars?\" - Ari\\n\\n\"I am a 26 year-old black woman born and raised in south central Los Angeles. And let me say this on behalf of my community. We\\'re tired and we\\'ve had enough. The police chief needs to resign today. And black life cannot be less valued than any property. What\\'s the point of insurance that all of these businesses legally must have. We demand a defunding of the police. We demand a budget in support of the people. Let\\'s talk about how my ancestors were brought to this country to build it up for free and be brutalized and killed mercilessly in the street. Let\\'s talk about how the police originated from slave catchers. Let\\'s talk about the lack of representation on this board currently. Where\\'s the commissioner that will speak up for me? Where\\'s the representation for black women? This is bigger than George Floyd. This is about the systemic racism that this country is built upon. Police would rather silence protestors than march along with us in the streets. Why is that the divide is promoted with rubber bullets, shooting directly at peaceful protestors? Tear gas has been banned in warfare but not in our streets.\" - Nicole\\n\\n\"I am a teacher in LAUSD and I teach children of color. And I am sick and tired of having to make excuses and having to tell my students that the police is there to protect them and protect the people around them. I\\'m a Latina and I\\'m also a mother and I have a son and I fear for him every time he goes out with his friends. Because I have to have the talk with him about what to do if he is profiled because of the way he looks. I\\'m tired of having to hear prayers and thoughts. And I am tired of people not listening to our young people. You need to listen to Black Lives Matters\\' demands and adopt the people\\'s budget.

Unthinkable cruelty to me.\" - Caroline A.\\n\\n\"You, the board members, have a chance not to stand with the fascists. You all heard the president just yesterday declare war against black and brown people, even while just a few weeks earlier he praised armed white militias for standing for liberty against COVID-19 restrictions. The mayor of LA originally said he would not call the National Guard. An hour later he called the National Guard. You\\'re closer to fascism than you would like to think.\" - JT\\n\\n\"There\\'s plenty of things to be enraged about when it comes to the LAPD. They\\'ve killed more than 610 people based on 10-year-old data. I\\'m sure it\\'s many more than that now. The point is not the completely atonal concern about civil unrest, as Chief Michael Moore just put it. What the citizens are actually concerned about is the constant escalation of police violence and the curtailing of first amendment rights. This is *civil* unrest by definition and Chief Moore should resign...Within this context, the fact the LA City Council has irresponsibly and undemocratically decided that the LAPD will be taking 3 billion of the city\\'s budget this year while all other city departments are starved of funding is appalling. This is legally and disproportionally choking the life out of communities of color on a macro scale. In light of this, while the department can\\'t even set up an adequate IT interface for a meeting like this today with the staggering amount of funding you have, how on earth is anyone supposed to trust you to solve the infinitely more complex problem of systemic racism.\" - Ryan A & Lily W.\\n\\n\"Hi, I\\'ve been on this call for over an hour and a half and I have only heard about six African-American voices. This is less than 10% of the 48 comments that have been listed so far...you have failed them. You have failed us, the Latino community doesn\\'t believe in you. None of us believe in you because you have failed us. And for you to just sit there with your face mask, not even looking up is bullshit. You need to be fired Chief Moore. You need to really resign. This is bullshit. I\\'m shaking, I\\'m in so much anger that most of people are calling are white. Thank you for your solidarity, but really, yield your time to the people of color. Let those people speak. LET THEM SPEAK. Your fucking bullshit is not cutting it. You need to actually listen to the black community. Why are only seven people that are black being heard during this comment. If they are not calling in, it\\'s because they don\\'t believe their voices are heard. LISTEN TO THEM. You\\'re not listening. You\\'re just adding military force to this bullshit. Fuck you...Really listen to the people, listen to what they\\'re saying. Actually do something right. Resign Chief Moore, resign. Fuck you.\" - Amparo O.\\n\\n\"I just want to say that the chief of police should be removed for his remarks alone. The sheer stupidity of them reveals that he is completely inept to be the leader of the police force. That was an embarrassment. The comments themselves were intimidating and he is a terrifying white racist. But the stupidity of those remarks just add to the terror of having someone like him be the leader. I don\\'t know why you guys are taking 3 billion dollars...considering your ineptitude and deep racist policies.Whenever I\\'m at the protest, the thing that makes me the most nervous are your cops. The gear that they show up in is terrifying and this whole time, across social media and in person, I\\'ve only seen your cops taunting and antagonizing and straight up assaulting the protestors. I don\\'t know why there is a question of where the violence is coming from because it\\'s clearly coming from the police. There are no protestors who show up in gear even closely equivalent to what the police show up in. I think you need to be removed from your office.\" - Juni\\n\\n\"I am a 50-year-old man and grew up in South Central LA. I have to say that growing up, our saying used to say that the police department serves and protects to break a n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\'s neck...to tell you the truth, this has been going on more than 10, 20 years. I am an educated man, I left and came back to see the same thing going on. And what really bothers me is that as the pandemic hit, I watched the chief of police and his attitude, and how he spoke with the board of directors, and how he tweeted and how he had attitude. And I do call for his resign. I no longer live in LA County, but just watching him on this call shows his lack of professionalism, his lack of concern, and his lack of empathy. He acts just like our, sorry to say, president. It\\'s all about him and his $300,000 dollar salary. To me, as a person, it\\'s sick. As a professional, it\\'s sick. For you to be a public servant, to stand in front of people and stand in front of cities, and act the way you act, you should be ashamed of yourself. And I know your parents are ashamed of you. I\\'m not going to cuss. I\\'m not going to demean you. But you\\'ve hurt so many people\\'s lives. But now, this rage, and the hate that you gave these kids is backfiring on you.  You need to stop demoralizing and start demobilizing the police department or this is what you\\'re going to get. I\\'m sorry, but you created it and you have to fix it. I wish you guys the best, but you guys have to live with your conscience.\" - Drew C.\\n\\n\"I\\'m a resident, I was born and raised in South Central LA. I was part of the \\'92 riots and I didn\\'t ever think that me or my children would ever see this. I would just like to urge Chief Moore to really understand what his says before he says it. Because I\\'m one of those folks that feels that all police officers are not bad, but he makes it that much more difficult for them to do their jobs when they are risking their lives in the projects and different areas of the community like south Los Angeles when they are trying to build and bridge these relationships.\" - Caller 7218\\n\\n\"I was woken up last night by what sounded like a military firing squad. My neighborhood, so close to my house, sounded like stories I heard of the St. Valentine\\'s Day Massacre. And the only reason I knew people weren\\'t dead was because they were the tell-tale muted gunfire of rubber bullets being fired into a crowd. So let that sink in for a little bit. This is what the city has come to. LAPD is no long serving and protecting. And I come from a family of law enforcement. I understand that the job is tough, but this is ludicrous. And the situation that we have right now is more than just the George Floyd thing at this point. This is an open wound that has been festering in Los Angeles. My family has been here since the \\'30s. I\\'ve lived here all my life. This is about a broken societal contract. This is about people expressing rage over 600+ murders since the riots in \\'92, that I had to live through. This is a lack of accountability for the LAPD, that my father, as a parol agent, helped, tried, tried his damnedest to address. This about the cycle of despair that keep people living in tents on the streets, in broken houses, and in servitude to rich, white landlords. Day after day, and we have to hold down 3 or 4 jobs just to survive. The last thing I want to say is that black lives matter.

Or are you just that impatient to go do more of them? I see a lot of you, particularly Soboroff, only react when folks use profanity in their remarks.

But I am seeing the police do that. I dont know if leaving it to the police to quell rioting over police brutality is the right move either. At least the military has some discipline. I'm kinda starting to think that the military in this situation is almost more pointed towards the police, at least in so much as stopping the rioting with less brutality and bs that the cops themselves are causing. \\n\\nIdk. This I think is a much tougher choice or decision than it appears on the surface.

Since everything is lit by LED, I seriously doubt it contributes much to the calculation but the lights are on a timer anyway so they've stayed on. We're still using our servers and desktops to run heavy computations through remote access. Those machines consume a significant amount of electricity and produce a significant amount of heat that the HVAC system must work to dissipate. All maintenance activities are still in effect, so the power draw from such things has continued as well. Basically, the office power draw might dip a few percent because we're not contributing to the heat capacity of the building (i.e. body heat), pumping and heating water, or running the kitchen appliances. Keep in mind that industrial systems are designed with ruthless efficiency in mind, and that residential systems are predominately designed to be cheap - but they do seem to be charged more for the same services in general...so, relative efficiency could be all over the board.\\n\\nPer this site, GA PWR earns \\\\~40% of it's revenue from residential in 2018.

We\\'d served together in the National Guard back in the late 90s to early 00s, when I separated. Then, in 2007, I unexpectedly ran into him at a neighborhood party, he was there with a friend of a friend.\\n\\nI\\'ll preface this with the fact that I\\'m going off of memory of a conversation I had 13 years ago regarding events that occurred 15 years ago. Some details may be fuzzy or wrong and I have no way of verifying since I haven\\'t seen him in many years. \\n\\nAnyway, he\\'d been deployed to New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina. He was assigned a group of guys who\\'d returned from Afghanistan or Iraq and was sent into a neighborhood to provide support to local law enforcement. The way he told it, he was looking to have a conversation with whomever was in charge on the ground and essentially went looking for them. He found them at some residence and, not thinking anything of it, left his guys in the street and started for the front door of the residence. As he was crossing the front yard, the cops step out with a bunch of shit they\\'d taken from the abandoned house. Pretty sure he said one of them was carrying a TV, some shit like that. \\n\\nHe said it was a deer in the headlights moment where the cops clearly hadn\\'t expected him. There were words exchanged, I think he\\'d told them to put the shit back or something similar. They didn\\'t appreciate being ordered around in their own city and fucking drew down on him. I don\\'t remember if it was one cop or more.\\n\\nBut, obviously, his guys were behind him and they reacted immediately, turning it into a little stand off. He basically told them: Shoot me and my guys will drop all of you. You\\'re going to lose.\\n\\nThe cops relented and dropped their shit. Unfortunately, I don\\'t remember anything else. I have no idea what happened afterward. I got the sense it was a fucked up situation and he basically took the \"I\\'ll do my job while I\\'m here but can\\'t do anything about what I don\\'t see\" approach.')],\n",

Nothing changes when they are caught doing it.\\n\\nThe US army's own study on political reforms, insurgencies, revolutions acknowledges that nothing changes without violence or the credible threat of violence. The SOCOM study on the Civil Rights Movement credits Malcom X, the Black Panthers, and millions of dollars worth of damage from arson, riots, and fear of a race war as a primary cause for the negotiations on civil rights. Without seeing what can happen the majority (like myself) will just sit on the fence and ignore the problem.\\n\\nSo every time people say violence solves nothing they're full of shit. The US government thinks that violence solves things. That's why they are pepper spraying, gassing, beating, and shooting rubber bullets into crowds peaceful or otherwise.

I used to play in team chat and started climbing when I left it. It hurts more than it helps. Remember, you make up only 16% of your team. The best thing you can do is play well and not worry about the negativity.\\n\\nI climbed by playing ult-cancelling heroes, mostly Brig. You can’t really rely on your team to communicate, so you kind of need to be like “well hell I’ll save your asses myself.” I’m a big fan of frog and bap, but their kits only allow you to save a team every so often. With brig you can cancel and postpone ults on every engagement, and that’s huge. Do I get a huge groan every time I pick her? Yes. Do I get endorsed for cancelling a reaper ult on point with 25 seconds left? Also yes. These plays win games and you need to play your ult cancels well in lower elos. I almost always use support ults defensively in lower elos.\\n\\nAlso I found that playing late at night does not equate to good games weirdly.\\n\\nLearn what is your fault, what isn’t your fault, and stand your ground. You’ll get a little more confident and start stacking wins. You’ve got this.
