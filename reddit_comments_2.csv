4,leakiny89ogui,gzb1n7x,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren plans to introduce legislation during this congressional session that would bar members of Congress and other top government officials from buying and selling individual stocks, she told Insider.

""It is a no-brainer,"" said Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat. ""Every senator, member of Congress, president, Cabinet secretary, federal judge, and other senior officials in charge of writing the rules for our financial system should not be able to own or trade individual stocks.""

The legislation would be based on the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act, which Warren introduced in 2018 and reintroduced in 2020, both times without Senate cosponsors. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, sponsored companion legislation in the House last year.

Both Warren bills died in the then-Republican-controlled Senate Finance Committee.

What's different now is that Democrats control the Senate, and Warren, who sits on the Finance Committee, has greater leverage to push the bill forward.

Numerous members of Congress have come under scrutiny for their stock trades in recent months. They include Sens. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican; Rep. Tom Malinowski, a New Jersey Democrat; and former Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, both Republicans of Georgia.

Rep. Chris Collins, a New York Republican, went to federal prison last year after pleading guilty to insider-trading charges. But Collins served time for only a few weeks before President Donald Trump pardoned him in December.

Top government officials, Warren said, ""are there to serve the people, not their personal financial interests.""

She continued: ""Congress should pass anti-corruption legislation and restore American's faith in government by making it work for everyone ‚Äî not just the rich and powerful.""

Warren did not offer a specific timetable for when she planned to introduce her stock-trading legislation this congressional session, which concludes in January 2023.",0.09277597402597403,t3_nk564e

if someone can't invest in AAL, DAL, LUV etc. but can buy all the JETS they want, do they have any less incentive to pump the airlines?

The stock market is so heavily manipulated, and as much as the government loves to attack various markets (especially my beloved crypto), they know damn good and well that they can move markets with even rumors of things like laws. Hell, not only can they, it is pretty much Yellen's favorite past times these days. 

I get tired of hearing Yellen and people like the SEC are there for the people. Anyone who believes the them, get your head out of the sand. A large amount of their regulations do nothing but put unnecessary restraint on retail traders and investors. If I want to put my life savings on 100x leverage on a trash stock, I should be allowed. My money is mine to throw away if I good and well please. If I am trading margin without understanding the risk that carries, that is on me and I promise I will learn the lesson quick. Sometimes you have to burn your hand on the stove to learn not to touch it. 

We also see the government very often take the side of Wall Street, and just keep the vicious cycle going. When retail traders get burned, it's crickets. If the big boys get burned, man the government is quick to start talking about new regulations and to bail them out. Take the Gamestop short squeeze for example. Those big boys do that shit to retail investors every day, but the moment it happened to them, all hell broke loose. All I can say is they are big boys, and they knew the risk of taking a short positions. Maybe they should have been more responsible with their trading.

We have enough of this manipulation going on from the big players on Wall Street, I would love members of congress and even people in equivalent positions of power in the government to not be allowed to trade. I know I saw a comment that we have seen proof that they have used inside information for their trading. The Federal government's job is to take care of our economy, not to take advantage of it. I believe we also saw it in 2020 right before COVID if I am not mistaken. 

So for once, and I never thought I'd see the day I said this, Warren is on to something. These are the issues I like seeing addressed. Mad props to her for being one of the few senators actually doing their damn job while the rest play grab ass and argue over shit the government shouldn't be involved in to begin with.",0.07951556990018528,t3_nk564e

He has a fifth sense. It's like he has [ESPN or something.](https://youtu.be/N0PpEoKHlO0?t=32s)

Sure, there have been some recent and memorable stories of senators and members of Congress making great sums of money from knowledge they obtained in their positions of power, which is unfair and corrupt. Curtailing any future incidents is a great endeavor, however, I would be concerned that this would negatively impact more congressmen who have not done anything wrong than it would correct the wrong-doers.

The internet tells me that the annual salary of a rank-and-file member of congress is $174,000. Though $174k is a great income for many Americans, some of these congressmen may require a extra income to meet their standard of living, particularly in high cost of living areas in the United States. Many of these officials are providing for their families, and may be taking a pay cut for these positions. You have to imagine that many congressmen are barred attorneys, PhD and/ MBA recipients, and therefore would be in high demand in the private sector.

As an avid stock trader myself, I think stripping them the right to engage in the publicly traded stock market is not fair to these members of Congress.

Specifically, make them required to report in full all transactions and holdings, and instantaneously. Currently lawmakers have to report within 90 days any trades above the certain threshold.

The bipartisanship from that movement had literally zero to do with turnover in Congress. It was because the people who were elected in those places chose to be bipartisan and self-serving.

You really think that movement would have happened if those same greedy politicians knew they couldn't hold onto that power for more than a couple terms? That kind of disaster would be mitigated by term limits.

Citing something bad happening when there were no term limits as an argument against them is fucking stupid.

>Term limits have a bunch of fairly negative side of effects. It promotes hyper partisanship.

Well we don't have term limits now and that's already happened. So again, your citing a negative that has occurred when we don't currently have term limits.

It's a stupid fucking argument.

>You also have zero reason to not ask for money and bribes. After all, you will be gone and you'll leave that behind.

Again, that already happens because these people think they can milk it for the next 30 years.

>In contrast, a lifelong career politician serving their district for 50+ years as a public figure has their legacy to consider.

Yea because we've never seen career politicians turn out to be deceitful criminals before. /s

Another stupid argument.

>Also, if they are are in office for 50+ years, they will have long established relationships with all sorts of people. This helps to grease the wheels of cooperation. 

You don't need a 50+ year relationship to get people to cooperate. This is irrelevant.

>With all the turn over that has happened since 2010 - cooperation has tanked. Bipartisanship has tanked. Corruption has skyrocketed.

And all of that happened when we didn't have term limits.

You're confusing causation with correlation, which is why all your points sound stupid and illogical.

How can term limits be a bad thing simply because there was turnover 10 years ago? Clearly there hasn't been as much turnover since then and the issues you've attributed to that initial turnover have only increased. Meaning the issues weren't simply because of the turnover but rather other varying factors that have nothing to do with the turnover. 

If we had term limits, most of those people responsible for the bipartisanship would be coming up on the end of their available terms and we'd have a chance to right the ship.

Unfortunately, we don't have term limits so there is no telling how much longer we'll have to deal with these issues you've described, which are not caused by term limits because they're happening while we do not have them in place.",-0.1163690476190476,t3_nk564e

A company officer selling stocks because he knows confidential company information that will soon become public and impact the stock price, for example, is against the law.

Trading on insider info when you shouldn't have it is legal, but the means you went to in order to obtain that information may have been illegal. If the CEO of a public company tells you in secret that his company is about to report earnings that will affect its stock price, you are legally allowed to act on that information. If, however, you break into his office to steal that information, you have broken the law above and beyond simple burglary. 

For someone who is not an insider (defined as officers, directors, or anyone with more than 10% of a company) to be guilty of illegal insider trading, they must have not only acquired confidential information from an insider, but that insider must have profited from it and the person who received the information must have known that they profited from it and that they were breaching their fiduciary duty.",-0.08897058823529413,t3_nk564e

Example: 

A person seeing a wet alone kid on the side of the highway you would stop and help. How can you ignore that child's face at the time. And let's assume the kid is American, why that fucking matters I do not know but it seems to matter. But we ignore the kids of immigrants, which I personally find weird as we are all of the same planet and same fucking race.

I guess those kids must suffer because some set of Americans feel they are shit or something.

If anyone, regardless of party, could stomach seeing kids suffer is a thing at all, IMO, then we should reevaluate everything.

‚ÄúIn theory, the STOCK Act made it clear that members of Congress and their staff have to play by the same insider trading rules as everyone else. Unfortunately, Congress has quietly returned to its old ways now that it thinks nobody is looking.

First, Congress quietly gutted a key disclosure provision of the STOCK Act ‚Äî a change that President Obama signed into law despite trumpeting the original Act as a victory for transparency. The change was made as quietly as possible: according to an NPR investigation, ‚ÄúThe whole process took only 30 seconds. There was no debate.‚Äù The White House‚Äôs official statement was just one sentence long, as issued on April 15, 2013 ‚Äî the same day as the Boston Marathon bombing.

Now, Congress is taking things a step further by actively stonewalling the first ever investigation into Congressional insider trading under the STOCK Act. Brian Sutter, a former staffer for the House Ways and Means Committee, is at the center of it all ‚Äî it‚Äôs alleged that in April 2013, he told a lobbyist about an imminent change to Medicare. That lobbyist then shared the information with other firms who were able to use it to trade on health insurance stocks that would be impacted.

2832,trilobyte-dev,gzbtoep,"It's more complicated than that as there are a few different types of options, and you can buy or sell any of them.

The most important thing to know about an option is that you are paying a small price to have the option to buy something else later on.   As a concrete example, let's say you think the price of a stock will go up from $100 in the next 6 months.  You may buy a call option on that stock for $1/each that says you have the option to buy that stock @ $110 / share 6 months from now.  The $1 is your premium, and that's a sunk cost.  Options are sold in bundles of 100 called a contract, and so let's say you buy one contract for a call option on your stock:

$1 * 1 contract * 100 = $100 for the Call Option

You're out that $100 no matter what.  Let's say that the stock price goes up to $130 in 6 months, you would then exercise your option and be able to buy 100 shares of the stock for $110 each, earning you an immediate $20 a share ($130 - $110 = $20) * 100 shares = $2000 profit (technically, your profit is (($130 - $110) * 100 shares - ($1 * 100 shares) = $1900), but don't get too hung up that part... you've already spent your $100 anyway)

Now, let's say the stock goes down instead from $100 / share to $90 a share.  What do you do? You do nothing!  You don't exercise your call option, it expires, and you are still only out the $100 you paid for the premium to buy the option.

Now, the thing to keep in mind is that when you buy an option, there is someone on the other side who is selling to you.  In our example, your call option is sold by someone else who is betting the price will go down.  Looking at our simple example from their perspective, they got paid the $100 from you upfront regardless of what happens, but if the stock goes up they need to have that stock available to sell to you at the agreed upon contract price of $110.

That's where things become more complicated.  What we described is referred to as ""buying a call"", and as we briefly touched on you can also ""sell a call"".  There are other types of options, most importantly ""puts"" which are like the inverse of the call, but again it all gets quite a bit more risky and requires understanding a lot more of the details.

But coming back around, the most important thing to remember when buying any kind of option is that you are buying optionality, by which I mean if things don't go the way you expect them to go you don't have to exercise the option.  You'll be out the premium you paid, but it's better than having to buy a stock for more than it's currently worth on the market.",0.14821428571428572,t3_nk564e

Fun fact: the SEC probably can‚Äôt do anything about the law when it comes to members of Congress.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1165156

‚ÄúSome supporters of the Stock Act thought it clearly banned the buying or selling of stocks based solely on information members of Congress learn about on the job, because it brought them under that ""relationship of trust or confidence"" rule ‚Äî namely, their duty to the public. But that concept has never been tested in court, and some former SEC officials have said they doubt that members of Congress have a duty of confidentiality.

But even if that approach of the insider trading law clearly did apply to Congress, bringing a criminal case would be difficult for prosecutors because of the immunity provided by the Constitution's speech or debate clause.‚Äù 

So in summary; theoretically a member of Congress could be held accountable, but it‚Äôs never been tested in court, and most likely never will. Plus the very law that was passed to address this loophole was gutted by the very people it was meant to hold accountable. It‚Äôs like saying there is no problem with police brutality because, in theory police are held to the same or higher standards than the general public.

The claim that smart and ambitious people want both simply isn't verifiable, and one could just as easily claim that money gets in the way of smart and ambitious people being able to run for office in the first place due to lacking the means to do so. There are people in many fields that will certainly accept lower pay if it means they get to do the work that they want to do, I don't see why the same can't be true in politics. 



Claiming that smart and ambitious people are naturally drawn to money also places a positive value on someone who wants to obtain money over those who don't, for example, those who do volunteer work. This will naturally shape the society in a way where prioritising money will be valued higher even if other people disagree on how important it should be. This ties into the issue of lobbying, and how everyone's vote is meant to be equal but special interest groups with more money can thus have a bigger influence on democracy when their influence should be 0.

It also seems to be pretty easy to point to someone like AOC who refuses to own stocks as someone who is both smart and ambitious that was drawn to politics without a desire for a ton of money. 

You can also point to someone like Ted Cruz who clearly cares about money, but you'd struggle to call him smart after his actions of leaving the US during the Texas power crisis.

3231,inoveryourtoes,hyo59bo,"I‚Äôve been going over some of the Trump era rhetoric toward NATO. The 2018 summit got lost with all the other drama, but this bit is pretty prescient:

> This past July, on the final day of the nato summit in Brussels, Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, proposed a closed-door emergency meeting. The emergency was Donald Trump. Minutes earlier, the President had arrived late to a session where the **Presidents of Ukraine and Georgia were making their case to join nato**. Trump interrupted their presentation and unleashed a verbal assault on the members of the alliance, calling them deadbeats and free riders on American power. Trump threatened to go his ‚Äúown way‚Äù if they didn‚Äôt immediately pay more for their own defense. His barrage centered on Merkel, Europe‚Äôs longest-serving democratic leader.

Trumo was looking for excuses to sour the US‚Äôs opinion of NATO, and idiots ate that up. He was undermining the alliance that is Putin‚Äôs number one problem. And what a coincidence that this outburst comes just as Ukraine and Georgia are making their case for membership. Hmmm‚Ä¶.

> ‚ÄúYou, Angela,‚Äù Trump chided Merkel. Most of nato‚Äôs members had failed to fulfill the goal of spending two per cent of G.D.P. for defense, but Trump focussed on Germany‚Äôs military spending of just over one per cent of G.D.P. In front of television cameras the previous day, he had accused Germany of being ‚Äútotally controlled by Russia,‚Äù because of a proposed new gas pipeline. His tweets that day sounded like blackmail. ‚ÄúWhat good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? The U.S. is paying for Europe‚Äôs protection, then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY, not by 2025.‚Äù

In fact, the [US trade deficit with Europe had gone up during Trump‚Äôs tenure, and Europe had upped their NATO spending prior to Trump taking office](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/12/factchecking-trumps-nato-remarks/). Under Trump, it continued to go up, but they were under no obligation to do so and they had been doing that of their own accord. They didn‚Äôt owe us anything. 

>And yet, when he emerged from the meeting and spoke with reporters, Trump lied, claiming not only that his allies had capitulated to him but also that they would consider his demand to raise their annual military spending to four per cent of G.D.P., an assertion so politically impossible that Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, immediately issued a public rebuttal. Trump, of course, went on behaving in his erratic, inexplicable manner. As he left the summit, he interrupted the Chancellor while she was addressing her fellow nato leaders, and kissed her. ‚ÄúI love this woman,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt she great?‚Äù A senior German official who told me about that particular Trumpian flourish resisted any attempt at full understanding. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to psychologists and historians what to make of that,‚Äù he said. Four days later, Trump ended his European tour in Helsinki. There, standing next to Vladimir Putin, he spoke with bewildering sympathy for Russian foreign policy, ill-concealed contempt for his nato partners, and implausible skepticism about his own intelligence services.

So Trump didn‚Äôt help our trade deficits with the EU, and NATO spending had been steadily increasing prior to his taking office. He verbally assaulted our allies and demeaned the NATO organization, causing it to lose stature and be seen as faltering or weak.

He didn‚Äôt care about Nord Stream, he cared about pissing Merkel off and he used their energy independence as a pretext for doing that. His sanction of a small Swiss firm who was working on a tiny fraction of the pipeline did nothing to stop the project. 

His rantings were counter-productive and ineffectual, unless you‚Äôre a Russian. When you look back over Trump‚Äôs record on NATO, knowing what we do about Putin‚Äôs obesssive hatred for the alliance, his actions seem decidedly traitorous.",0.026278409090909085,t3_t2suj2

Check out the book, [Foundations of Geopolitics by Aleksandr Dugin] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics), which is a book that details how Russia should approach increasing their sphere of influence. Finland's section reads:

""Finland should be absorbed into Russia. Southern Finland will be combined with the Republic of Karelia and northern Finland will be ""donated to Murmansk Oblast"".""

Finland will be next after this Ukraine crisis. At the section for Ukraine it reads:

""Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because ""Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics"". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.""

Their plan for the US is to:

""fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"". Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements ‚Äì extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S.""

Think about [""Russian troll farms""] (https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/.../troll-farms-and-fake-news...) that continually stir things up on different social media platforms to get us, the American people, to be at each other's throats over such trivial things. Think about what it says for the UK:

""The United Kingdom, merely described as an ""extraterritorial floating base of the U.S."", should be cut off from Europe.""

and then think about how more research is coming out to show that [Russian troll farms played a part in the Brexit vote as well] (https://www.npr.org/2019/01/19/686830510/senate-finds-russian-bots-bucks-helped-push-brexit-vote-through). People treat them like ""trolls"" & not foreign digital attacks on the people of other nations aiming to cause instability.

This needs to be a wake up call. This is Putin's game plan for the world. MAKE NO MISTAKE, it isn't the Russian citizens who want this. It's the Russian elites, it's Putin & his oligarchs who want this. And they won't stop with Ukraine. It's just one step in their plan.",-0.01342857142857143,t3_t2suj2

Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.
Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual civil war, because now brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other, but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

Jan. 14, 2019 WASHINGTON ‚Äî There are few things that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia desires more than the weakening of NATO, the military alliance among the United States, Europe and Canada that has deterred Soviet and Russian aggression for 70 years.

Last year, President Trump suggested a move tantamount to destroying NATO: the withdrawal of the United States.

Senior administration officials told The New York Times that several times over the course of 2018, Mr. Trump privately said he wanted to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Current and former officials who support the alliance said they feared Mr. Trump could return to his threat as allied military spending continued to lag behind the goals the president had set.

In the days around a tumultuous NATO summit meeting last summer, they said, Mr. Trump told his top national security officials that he did not see the point of the military alliance, which he presented as a drain on the United States.",-0.04242424242424242,t3_t2suj2

a) Various officials from Pentagon and US Government have been calling for a war with Russia for the last eight years.

b) The West has dismissed Russian statement that US wants to position nuclear missiles on Ukrainian soil as a conspiracy theory, but Ukrainian president openly said in Munich that he wanted to break the Budapest Memorandum, which specified that Ukraine can‚Äôt possess nuclear weapons.

c) nuclear weapons on Ukrainian soil would leave Russia unable to defend itself in any meaningful way in case of aggression because it‚Äôs just four minutes away as the missile flies, leading to massive casualties and total defeat within less than ten minutes. This would fundamentally alter the global balance of power and pose an unprecedented existential threat to Russia as a nation.

d) there‚Äôs been what amounts to an ethnically-motivated armed conflict against Russian-speaking Ukrainians in Donbas for eight years, which caused about a million Ukrainian citizens flee TO Russia, the supposed instigator of the conflict according to western media.

e) Ukraine repeatedly refused to adhere to the Minks agreement and resolve the Donbas situation diplomatically.

f) US and NATO refused to deny future Ukrainian membership, despite there being declassified documents that confirm the promise of non-expansion into the Eastern Europe made to the Soviet Union.

Putin is acting increasingly unstable and delusional. Even if and when his army overruns Ukraine, occupies it, and subdues the regular Ukrainian armed forces, the Ukrainians are almost guaranteed to settle into a bloody insurgency that would bleed Russia for as long as there are Russian troops in that country. 

We have to face the growing possibility that rather than accept a failure, Putin will react by escalating and spreading the war wider. If he attacks any of our NATO allies, he will hit U.S. troops, and we will be at war with Russia. At that point, supporting Putin would be treasonous with no 'almost' about it.",-0.08166666666666669,t3_t2suj2

They're not conserving anything. If I recall, an old philosopher, travelling through the US in the last century, made the statement, ""The democrats make the mistake and the republicans don't fix them.""  


This is the massive blunder the dual oligarchic party system brings. Until real voices are allowed to make themselves known, rather than simply who makes the most money, the North American Union will never be able to properly respect the rights and interests of its citizens. More jobs will be given to other countries at the US's expense. This will have a detrimental effect on the Union's capacity to protect its own political interests. Or any of its interests for that matter. Mitt Romney, like General Floyd and several other politicians, have sold out the United State for selfish gain. Especially when it comes to the cheap labor of countries like China, India and Vietnam.   


I find it astonishing that he dares declare that anyone who shows even the most nominal sense of even-headedness concerning the situation in Ukraine is an ""almost traitor"", when he's doing Xi Jing Ping's bidding and insulting republicans whilst demanding that they vote for him.  


Putin has made three demands of President Zelensky:  


1. Do not join NATO or the European Union.
2. Respect the rights of ethnic Russians in Donbas
3. A complete denazification of Ukranian government officials  


In retrospect, this doesn't seem unreasonable. There seems to be a lot that we're not being told. But with these demands, it seems that Zelensky is willing to put Ukranian lives at risk to forcibly remove any Russians from Ukraine and to join NATO. If Ukraine joins NATO, this will mean that nuclear weapons will be brought into the region, which Putin has said, is not acceptable. Remember that the reason he's invading is to ensure that this doesn't happen. People in the west can call the Russians the aggressors, but that's to remove any responsibility they have in attempting to place nuclear weapons in Ukraine and to increase Russian border spending. In essence, I doubt Putin felt that he had a choice in the matter, but to invade.

We should never glorify anyone. Putin has his downsides as well. And so does Zelensky. So taking a side when nuclear weapons are involved is a foolhardy response. Remember that nobody wins in a nuclear war. 

But for those of you who can't be expected to have a reasonable argument about a matter that is probably poorly understood and heavily propagandized by the media (shocking I know), you should go play that new Elden Ring game that just came out three days ago. It's great! I love it! This might give you a chance to relax, and think with a clear head. It wasn't that long ago that Canada's Prime Minister Trudeau, ran over an old lady who was peacefully protesting the vaccine passports and other stuff.

to US involvement and comparing the invasion of the Ukraine to the 2003 Iraq  
war. Let‚Äôs just look at the facts.   
Facts  
1.We Attacked Iraq unprovoked. They did not attack us, nor  
did they want to fight us.  
2. We blatantly lied about WMDs. We clearly wanted to invade  
Iraq for geopolitical goals, and made about WMDs and other nonsense like  
""yellow cake"" to justify invading.  
3. When we attacked Iraq, we directly attacked civilian  
infrastructure. Many Iraqis went without electricity and water for more then a  
year.  
4. It is reported that more then 185,000‚Äì208,000 civilian  
deaths occurred because of the Iraq war.  
5.The Iraq war destabilized the religion, and Iraqi  
Christians were forced to leave when ISIS showed up. They lived there for  
thousands of years.  
I am not saying all this to be a bleeding heart liberal. I'm very conservative. I  
did deploy to Iraq in a combat MOS, 13b, I was used as in a infantry capacity  
during the conflict and served near the Iraq Iran boarder. I just don't  
understand the ""we da good guys, they the bad guys"". Russia is  
clearly attacking the Ukraine for geopolitical reasons that serve Russian  
interests, much like the war in Iraq. Neither one of these wars meet the  
criteria of Christian just war doctrine. Democracy is not a prerequisite for  
moral just Christian society, nor does US foreign policy represent anything  
other than serving national interests, ""making the world safe for  
democracy"" is a propaganda term. Think its best that we put aside  
nationalist bias when looking at conflicts like these. So when I say that it  
looks like Russia is using restraint, I mean that in the context of recent  
unprovoked conflicts. That is not a compliant to Putin. This does not make me a  
Russian supporter. I am so sick of Jingoistic neolibs and neoconsertives. I pray for Russia and the Ukraine, this war needs to stop.",0.0535076530612245,t3_t2suj2

Previously, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) opened a special account to accept donations for Ukraine's defense online via Patreon, by wire transfer, and by crypto.

Patreon closed the NBU's account because, understandably, they don't fundraise for military activities.

Wire transfer and crypto options aren't accessible or convenient for many people. The NBU, less than a day ago, has updated their webpage with a new option to donate by credit / debit card.

See link below for said webpage with instructions, and in particular, the ""Transfer From A Card"" button.

[https://bank.gov.ua/en/news/all/natsionalniy-bank-vidkriv-spetsrahunok-dlya-zboru-koshtiv-na-potrebi-armiyi](https://bank.gov.ua/en/news/all/natsionalniy-bank-vidkriv-spetsrahunok-dlya-zboru-koshtiv-na-potrebi-armiyi)

Please donate and share.

There's surprisingly less media coverage about this than I expected, so I double checked that this is legitimate. The NBU webpage fundraising for Ukraine's defense is, in addition to being on the NBU's official website, also (1) mentioned by the official Twitter account of Ukraine, (2) mentioned by several news sources, including Bloomberg, Washington Post, and Business Insider, and (3) listed in the top pinned post in r/Ukraine. (I wouldn't spread information on sending money to foreign bank accounts without some due diligence first.) See links below.

Please note that:

I did a $20 test payment using the new ""card transfer"" option, and it seems to have worked: [https://imgur.com/a/Aj42dRT](https://imgur.com/a/Aj42dRT). There's a nominal processing fee involved.

I scheduled a $500 wire transfer with my bank, which also seems to have worked: [https://imgur.com/a/Aj42dRT](https://imgur.com/a/Aj42dRT). However, note the wired funds won't be available to the recipient for a little over a week. Not sure if there's a similar delay with the credit card payment, or if the credit card payment is actually faster.

If you're using wire transfer, you should donate a higher amount just so it's ""worth"" the wire transfer fee you might incur. (For example, doesn't make sense to pay $15 wire transfer fee to send $20.)

International wire transfer involving intermediary / correspondent banks is inconvenient and complicated if you haven't done them before, and they're not always an option and often involve wire transfer fees depending on your bank account.

You should always ALSO donate to conventional NGOs such as Doctors Without Borders, Red Cross, International Rescue Committee, UNICEF, UNHCR, etc. to support much needed humanitarian efforts. I would actually urge you to donate to humanitarian efforts first.

People circlejerk about the word ""treason"" all the time, but it's a very specific crime with - *gasp* - an actual definition. 

It's literally in the Constitution - ""Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.""

>18 U.S. Code ¬ß 2381 - Treason: Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.

\


> According to 50 USCS ¬ß 2204 [Title 50. War and National Defense; Chapter 39. Spoils of War], enemy of the United States means any country, government, group, or person that has been engaged in hostilities, whether or not lawfully authorized, with the United States;


Now there are no time restrictions on the definition of *enemy* so could be loosely defined as anyone who has ever done such a thing. Which would be a very long list. --> WRONG! this has been defined by common and case law to in the context of treason to mean ""fighting a shooting war against the USA"" 

Putin has ordered bounties on US soldiers, which would technically make him an ""Enemy of the United States"" under code. However, in relation to treason there is an implication that the enmity is current otherwise you could not show ""comfort"" to a British citizen. 

Further to *that* the first amendment is superior law; which means we need to look at the case law around times when the courts have interpreted speech to fall outside protection. Brandenburg v. Ohio 

>""the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.""

New York Times Co. v. Sullivan also might be useful in looking at false statements where license is granted to disagree with the government or individual to significant levels. 

*put it all together*

The bar for legal treason is obviously high as it is a capital offense therefore no official should accuse treason lightly, which may differ from the colloquial use. However for that legal use it would seem that ""adherence"" must be more than vocal support for or encouraging a change of state policy to become aligned with a group currently in opposition to the state. 

Past interpretation of ""treason"" has required ""actual mustering of men for war"" to pass before it can be invoked at all. 

Given there is no state of war, *and* even if there was suggesting there should not be is not treasonous these people cannot be described as *traitors*. 

A potential exists if they were telling deliberate lies with the intent to aid the conduct of a power that *was* recognised as being at war with the USA for this to be treason by adhering.",0.04432326220787759,t3_t2suj2

6253,WDfx2EU,hyq8w20,"The biggest threat to the existence of Republicans is the Democratic party, so they consider only other Americans to be their primary enemy. Everything else is a secondary concern.

They will give a half-hearted, ""Yes, this despotic regime is bad, but..."" and then will implicitly explain how they definitely do support that regime, simply because the Democrats don't. Lots of ""You have to admit..."" and ""Is it really so bad..."" and ""Why should we have to..."" type fallacies to avoid explicitly stating that they support enemies of the United States.

Ultimately they don't care about anything but themselves, and right now the Democratic party is the most immediate threat to their own personal circumstances, no matter how trivial (like wearing a mask). Russia can't enforce mask mandates on them, only the Dems. So Dems are the enemy and anyone the Dems are against is good. Morals, ethics, principles are all completely irrelevant and they only pretend to have them (anti-abortion, states rights, bathroom laws) insofar as it will cause Democrats to give them the benefit of the doubt as some sort of misguided, undereducated, naive group people who think they are doing what's right. 

The whole myth that ""they don't know any better"" and are simply brainwashed is a primary weakness of the Dem party, and any Republican knows how to use it to their benefit. All they actually care about is immediate self-benefit at the cost of others'. Fascism gives that to people as long as you just support whatever fascists do, so that's the end of their thought process.

They *can* have a more complex thought process, but they don't believe they *have to*. Dems tend to think it's because they just don't have the information and we need to argue with them. They absolutely have the information or know where to find it, but they don't see any reason to, because they never face repercussions from ignoring it. You can't change their mindset with facts or argument, only consequences and repercussions.

Anything else they tell you about why they do or don't support this and that is only because they know that you will believe what they say and they can use it as a manipulation tactic. They may even convince themselves that they believe these things on a surface, highly conscious level. Subconsciously, they're just finding reasons to justify doing things that benefit themselves. In the end, that is truly all they care about. If they don't face any consequences for it, they have no reason to change.

Remind yourself on a regular basis that a Republican is lying to you. They are always lying to you, from the beginning of the conversation to the end. Remind yourself that they absolutely do not care about a single thing in this world more than themselves. Once you accept that and stop trying to believe that they actually mean well, anything they say it predictable and the motivations are incredibly easy to understand.

I know that's incredibly hard for people who have right wing friends and family - it's not easy to believe they are knowingly lying to you and manipulating you. But consider for a second that they are and you'll see how quickly pieces start fitting together.

**EDIT:** I'm using Dems/Republicans as a descriptor for a much wider political division within the Western world that goes beyond American parties. Traditionally people may say left/right or liberal/conservative, but the entire idea that it is a one dimensional sliding scale with a comfortable middle is a fallacy in and of itself.",0.05955750224618149,t3_t2suj2

(But conception is arguably also delayed murder because nobody consents to conception, no baby consents to birth, every life ends in death, death is the inevitable end of birth, so creating a human life necessarily entails ending that same human life. If your parents put a timebomb in your heart that explodes after 120 years that is still murder. But the real timebomb is the aging process, unless something else kills you first). 

Abortion should be safe and legal vs unsafe and illegal, but I don‚Äôt know why pro-choice activists ignore the whole ending-human-life thing. Democrats could make non-consensual fertilization a crime, since unwanted pregnancies are the result of non-consensual fertilization, and they could attempt to pass a federal law making it federally legal to terminate a non-consensual pregnancy (and abortion used to be known as the euphemisms restoring a period, returning a period, or bringing on a period). Donald Trump wanted Marla Maples to abort Tiffany and Trump was self-described as pro-choice in the late 90s. But abortion is a culture war wedge issue the 1% use to divide the 99% so they are not united against the 1%. Just like Putin amplifies culture war wedge issues in America so America is not united against Putin.

And if killing is murder then killing animals for meat is murder. But if ‚Äúmurder‚Äù is only homicide, then killing non-humans isn‚Äôt murder, but it shouldn‚Äôt be legal to kill every animal someone owns or every animal in a country. Animal rights activists believe animals have the right to not be seen as property.

I think the fact is that abortion is murder, but it‚Äôs a murder people justify because of an unwanted pregnancy (they don‚Äôt want to be life support for another life without their consent), or don‚Äôt want to die from childbirth, or can‚Äôt afford or don‚Äôt want to raise a child. And meat is murder but it‚Äôs a murder people justify because they like the taste, or need nutrition, or that‚Äôs how they were raised, or it‚Äôs easier, or they believe might makes right, etc. But pro-life (pro-birth) activists will cite ‚Äúthou shalt not a kill‚Äù as a reason to ban abortion, even as they eat meat, or own guns made to kill, or be pro-military when war is just organized murder.",0.10607142857142855,t3_t2suj2

By repeating Russian propaganda talking points and disinformation while Russia wages a hybrid war on the US and its allies like Ukraine, by money laundering dirty Russian money especially by selling US real estate to Russian oligarchs or Russian mobsters, by calling Putin ‚Äúgenius‚Äù for invading Ukraine, by using a primetime rightwing TV show to question why anyone should hate Putin who is waging war on the US and who meddled in the 2016 US election and got a compromised puppet to win power, by being a white nationalist who said in 2004 that Russia is the key to white survival, by withholding anti-tank missiles from Ukraine in an an attempt to extort their democratically elected President who Putin now want to depose and imprison and kill as Russian T72 tanks invade Ukraine, by accepting funding and donations from Russian oligarchs and their middlemen, by admiring the anti-LGBT stance of Russia as a conservative utopia even as Russia limits gun rights and free speech and religious freedom, by being campaign manager for a Putin Puppet in Ukraine Yanukovych and also campaign manager for Putin Puppet in America Donald Trump, by getting all the funding you need out of Russia, by wanting to build a Trump Tower Moscow and give Putin a penthouse suite in it, by working on Trump Soho with Felix Sater of the Russian mob, by having Felix Sater make it so your daughter Ivanka can sit in Putin‚Äôs chair, by being paid $10M by Russian oligarch Aras Agalarov to hold the 2013 Miss Universe Pageant in Moscow, by working with a Russian oligarch to get an aluminum plant in Kentucky, by continuing to buy oil and methane from Russia, etc. Those are the actions of useful idiots like Donald Trump, his children, Mike Pompeo, the NRA, David Duke, Tucker Carlson, Fox News, Steve Bannon, Paul Manafort, RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel, and Mitch McConnell. But oil and gas also spreads the blood on consumer hands. It‚Äôs wrong to conflate any verbal support of Russia with treason, but Russia is waging war on America and its allies, and aiding or siding with the enemy in times of war is treason. The absence of an official declaration of war should not be a license to commit treason, because nuclear weapons make such declarations unlikely, even as Russia wages war with America.

I‚Äôve also heard Putin uses the term ‚Äúspecial military operation‚Äù and cracks down on people in Russia calling it a war or an invasion, even though that‚Äôs what it is, in addition to an attempted military coup of a sovereign state. Russia is also at war with America even though Putin has made no official declaration of war, with hacking, ransomware, election meddling, disinformation, psyops, the destabilization of countries and weaponization of refugees to trigger nativist xenophobia in the West, etc. And the reason that countries with nukes don‚Äôt make official declarations of war on other countries with nukes is so it doesn‚Äôt escalate to nuclear armageddon and mutually assured destruction. And after America lost the war in Vietnam after nearly 20 years, it doesn‚Äôt like making official declarations of war because America doesn‚Äôt want to admit it can lose a war. Treason is aiding and abetting the enemy during times of war, but some people argue there can be no treason without an official declaration of war. I would argue that nukes (and thefefore the fear of declaring war on a country with nukes) shouldn‚Äôt be a free license to commit treason by aiding an enemy with nukes, just because of the lack of some formal declaration of war.

Debates aren't, inherently, that bad. They're just bad for what they're used for. 

In the debate format, Obama scored an extremely strong point with the people, but it would have been a bunk one if the people listening were informed.

Romney's original statement was ""Russia is the US's biggest geopolitical threat"". They weren't, and they never were. Obama was 100% correct on that point. 

Russia does not have the position, industry nor military to serve as a geopolitical threat. That being said, however, that does not mean they aren't a threat in other ways, as we're seeing. 

Our Democracy suffers greatly due to a misinformed and ill-educated voter base. Debates are, inherently, useful, but they are not a tool that the majority of people can parse correctly. They're used wrong in the way that they're used. They're actively more harmful then they are helpful, and allow idiots like Trump to ""Score points"" on more qualified candidates like Biden or Hillary by exploiting the format, rather then the substance.

- The United Kingdom, merely described as an ""extraterritorial floating base of the U.S."", should be cut off from Europe.

- Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"". Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements ‚Äì extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics"".

- Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because ""Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics"".

I couldn't disagree more. Their fear is having their entire western flank encircled by an institution whose actual purpose is to reduce the global dominance of Russia. 

This is a very plausible threat to their national security. Historically Ukraine is a strategic weak point, in the last 2 world wars the soviets lost over 10 million soldiers through invasions through Ukraine alone.

It might seem silly to us as people living in liberal democracies, but NATO has a history of strong arming and destabilizing countries that do not hand over favorable trade deals to western/NATO countries (specifically the US). An actual national security threat like this could turn russia into a puppet state. You'll notice how many previously colonized countries (China) have stayed audibly neutral in this conflict, and this is why.

I wish that diplomacy had won out instead of this war, but I can not for the life of me understand why NATO would not just explicitly rule out expansion into Ukraine. Part of the soviet union dissolution agreement was that they would not expand post east Germany, and yet they've been ignoring their own terms. If NATO had made this statement, there would be no war.

Nothing about that private meeting was ever revealed. Eric Trump talked about how many dealings the Trump business did with Russians. In fact the majority of their businesses were with Russians.

7728,clintonexpress,hyrhqgp,"The two-party system is a natural consequence of the first-past-the-post voting system where voters vote for one candidate and the most votes wins, and the phenomenon of two dominant parties emerging is called Duverger‚Äôs law. Basically, with people fighting over a pie, two factions will emerge, each trying to get half the pie. But in first-past-the-post voting, a candidate really only needs a plurality of votes (the biggest slice of the pie), but not a majority of votes (over half of the pie), which means that that voting system can elect a candidate who most voters didn‚Äôt vote for (in a race of 3 or more people, 40% can be the biggest slice but that means 60% didn‚Äôt want to hire them), which would be minority rule. It also forces voters to consent to at least one candidate (pick the lesser of two evils), even if they don‚Äôt consent to any candidates on the ballot, because a blank ballot would not be counted as a ‚Äúno‚Äù vote.

And in US presidential elections, the problem of misrepresentation of voters‚Äô wants is made worse by ‚Äúwinner-take-all‚Äù electors (which isn‚Äôt in the Constitution, but is now used by 48 states) where bad math produces nonsensical results like rounding up 45% support by state residents and transforming it to 100% support by state electors (rather than proportional electors or fractional electoral votes) so if you vote in the minority in your state, then your vote for president is basically discarded and ignored and nullified and not represented, and winner-take-all electors is the only reason ‚Äúswing states‚Äù exist and why only votes in ‚Äúswing states‚Äù essentially make any difference in presidential elections in the US.

And voting third-party doesn‚Äôt break the two-party system, because the dominant two parties are used to getting half the votes or more, and the two major parties also raise the most money, making it unlikely that a third-party candidate would ever get more than 33% of the votes which they would need to ever win a 3-way race. And the spoiler effect means that people who vote for third parties in races between 3 or more candidates accidentally help the candidate most unlike the candidate they voted for, like how voters in Florida in 2000 who voted for Ralph Nader instead of the more similar Al Gore, ended up accidentally helping the more different George W. Bush win the state (besides the Supreme Court intervening).

The American Revolution involved the slogan ‚Äúno taxation without representation‚Äù, but the problem now is taxation with misrepresentation. Voters are misrepresented if a candidate who most voters didn‚Äôt vote for wins (due to plurality voting), voters are misrepresented if electors don‚Äôt proportionally represent the will of state residents (due to winner-take-all electors), and the Senate misrepresents state residents by giving 2 Senators per state regardless of population (so that states like Wyoming or North Dakota have as many Senators as California or Texas), and the House misrepresents state residents based on imaginary and arbitrary invisible district lines which are frequently redrawn by elected politicians themselves (so politicians end up choosing their voters). Which leads to misrepresentation in government (which is also due to primary voters frequently favoring the most extreme candidates).

Reddit uses approval voting, where you can upvote or downvote each submission and each comment. In some states, voters can vote yes or no on each judge on a ballot, or vote yes or no on each proposition on a ballot. In Congress, they can vote Aye or Nay on each bill brought to the floor. So there needs to be ballot initiatives (in every state that allows them) to switch to approval voting, which would allow voters to vote yes or no on each candidate, to express their consent or non-consent of each candidate, and the candidate with the highest approval wins. The Declaration of Independence says governments are only legitimate based on the consent of the governed, but minority consent is majority non-consent which is tyranny. In approval voting you can consent to as many candidates as you want, and the highest approval wins, and the percentage of the vote for each candidate would not all combine to 100%, it‚Äôs the approval plus disapproval of one candidate that would sum to 100%. I would also argue that silence is not consent, that consent is voluntary and affirmative, so non-voters who are eligible to vote should be counted as ‚Äúno‚Äù votes due to lack of support, lack of consent, lack of approval. That would also help address the problem of Republicans purging voter rolls of voters who skipped an election. Since Republicans increasingly can‚Äôt rely on getting the most votes, they have pivoted to pruning votes from people likely to vote Democrat.

Some people suggest ranked choice voting (RCV) instead, where you list candidates in order of preference. But the spoiler effect can still happen in RCV, which would leave the two-party system in place. And the counting of votes in RCV is more complicated than the counting of votes in approval voting. And I think RCV gives too much power to the craziest voters. In RCV if no candidate gets over 50% of votes in round 1 of vote counting, they look at last place (eg, the craziest voters who had Kanye as their #1 choice), then the craziest voters get their 2nd choice counted first, and then the 2nd choice of more sane voters, and so on.

Something like score voting (where a voter gives each candidate points like from 1 to 10 and the candidate with the highest points wins) would allow voters to vote for more than one candidate (like in approval voting), and also allow voters to express their preferences (like in ranked choice voting, by giving someone more points), but I think it would be too complicated for Americans, the total points for a candidate could easily exceed the number of voters so the point total for each candidate would be fishy and telling where points came from would involve a reference to each voter (but you could show average points given), it would arguably amplify the power of fraudulent ballots. But I think approval voting is simple enough and good enough to end the two-party system (especially if all elections can only be publicly funded without private donations).

Some people who are opposed to alternate voting systems like RCV or approval voting say things like ‚Äúone person one vote‚Äù (suggesting it allows people to vote more than once). But I would argue that a vote is an answer to a question, and one ballot (a voter‚Äôs collective vote) can contain multiple votes: multiple answers to multiple questions. It depends on what question is being asked. A first-past-the-post ballot basically asks ‚ÄúWho is the one and only person you want to win?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWho is your first choice to be hired?‚Äù A RCV ballot basically asks ‚ÄúIn which order do you prefer these candidates?‚Äù An approval voting ballot basically asks ‚ÄúDo you approve of this candidate?‚Äù but asks that same question about each candidate. You can‚Äôt get the right answer if you keep asking the wrong question. And it‚Äôs really bad if a country has a two-party system but one of the parties no longer believes in elections they lose, and lies about elections they lose, and seeks to overthrow elections they lose, because you can‚Äôt compromise with fascists who no longer honor democratic elections.",0.1396323914181057,t3_t2suj2

Many US states allow for ballot initiatives, like the ballot initiatives that led to many states legalizing medical marijuana or recreational marijuana, after enough signatures are gathered to put the proposed law on the ballot. I would suggest ballot initiatives (in every state that allows them) to switch a state to approval voting, where voters can vote yes or no on each candidate on the ballot, and the candidate with the highest approval wins (it would be like comparing different films by RottenTomatoes score, or sorting comments in a Reddit thread by best I think). That way voters are not limited to choosing the lesser of two evils, they will be able to vote no on evil, or even vote no for everyone in a given race for office. ‚ÄúNo‚Äù votes could be subtracted from ‚Äúyes‚Äù votes to show net approval, or candidates could just be compared by highest approval (although I would suggest that anyone under 50% approval would be eliminated from the race). Approval voting could also replace the stupid, months-long, state-by-state primary election process, which tends to favor extreme candidates and gives momentum to candidates simply based on the arbitrary order that different states hold primaries. There could be one national open primary election simultaneously in every state with like 100 candidates (where voters can vote yes or no on each candidate), and in round 2 the top 20 or top 10 could advance to the general election for the nation and voters can still vote yes or no on each candidate, and highest approval wins and gets hired to be President.

And winner-take-all electors (where a presidential candidate can get 45% of the votes in a state but gets nonsensically rounded up to 100% support by state electors), is not in the Constitution, it began in a few states and now 48 states use it to amplify their votes, but it makes it so a presidential candidate can win the Electoral College even if the majority of Americans never wanted to hire them for the job. The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, where certain states pledge to give their electoral votes to whoever wins the popular vote in America, could fix the problem of misrepresentation in the Electoral College if more states join it. Or Congress could make it illegal for electors to misrepresent the will of state residents, if they don‚Äôt accurately and proportionally represent state residents with proportional and fractional electoral votes (if a state had 10 electoral votes and a candidate got 45% of the vote, that candidate would get 4.5 electoral votes from electors from that state or they could be punished with fines or prison).",0.16102941176470584,t3_t2suj2

In the current situation, Putin is making an implicit threat that he will use nuclear weapons(probably tactical warheads mounted on cruise missiles) to devastate Ukrainian cities if foreign powers keep cockblocking him.  He could win if he was just fighting Ukraine, but against the entire west, especially with sanctions already beginning to cut deeply into his economy, impairing his ability to maintain his fighting forces; he just cannot win.  Also, as time has passed and Ukraine keeps fighting, they are getting more support from western nations, meaning Putin won't be able to win this war without WMDs.

WMDs are a dramatic escalation of conflict, and will certainly prompt a western response, if only because the wind will carry radioactive particles into Europe.

Putin thinks he can invade Ukraine because he‚Äôs a sociopath, and possibly veering into psychopath with this reckless operation.

Covid is easing down but still a problem for some countries like Ukraine (vaccination rates are stupidly low); the economy and inflation are in turbulence; lot of inter-EU and UK disputes; China/US tensions.

Either way Germany was Russia dependent- the Nordstream was supposed to make it cheaper and faster.

Honestly, all they can do is probably temporarily re-instate coal and nuclear, and take the heat politically from all the fanatical ideologists who can‚Äôt think practically for a minute.

There had never been anything on the scale of 2016, because social media made it easy.  So much so that Mueller brought charges against 10 Russia based agents in 2016 for doing this, and the GOP chaired Senate Intelligence Committee had to do a full report investigation into it and demonstrated staggering amounts of such activity in its final report.

You expect me to believe that Biden reversed everything Trump did in a week, but somehow the abandonment of billions in equipment, foreign national contractors, and *American citizens* just slipped through the cracks?

Ok, so let's say I believe you.  Your version is the correct one.   That makes Biden and his administration horribly incompetent.  Biden would have been more focused on letting trans serve in the military than he would have been making sure we didn't forget our own people in Afghanistan like they were Kevin McCallister at Christmas time. 

Or...

Biden wanted to set the stage for his first 100 days, and show everyone that he was nothing like Trump.  So he took the existing plan, threw it away, extended the dealine for the withdrawal so he could fabricate his own, and if it had played out better he absolutely would have taken credit for it.  

That withdrawal had the stench of something that everyone in the military knows.   The total lack of planning that stems from a last minute massive change to the mission.   There was an uncharacteristic lack of preparedness to this.  The military is an occasionally awkward moving, but cohesive machine.   The military is as graceful as a great Dane on ice skates.  The amount of accountability for *every single thing* is so mind boggling.  Every item down to pens have someone who signed for it,  and is therefore accountable either financially or even criminally.  It was definitely a literal last possible minute change. 

Not to mention that Trump hates brown people and it makes no sense that he would intentionally give the Taliban such a publicly embarrassing win, but also all that equipment.   Literal billions in weapons.   Reconcile that.   Racist Trump gave *The Taliban* (Muslim extremists that are the white Christian Republican arch nemesis) a ton of state of the art military technology and all those guns and vehicles.

He feigns outrage at the wealthy and then continues to support the exact systems that make them so wealthy and powerful while shifting the focus to a nationalist framing rather than. Class analysis. Essentially he knows people are pissed off because of their material conditions, but his solution is to do more flag waving to get them in line.

Mussolini did a similar thing in Italy. He adopted left wing rhetoric (he was an actual socialist in his younger days, but didn't like their antiwar stances) and even went as far as to implement massive government programs, including infrastructure programs, jobs programs, etc while pushing for a more and more nationalist approach even convincing people to donate gold jewelry to the government in exchange for wrist bands. On top of that, he increased the coordination between the government and corporations essentially creating a unified national power block which allowed the wealthy to continue making their money in exchange for a greater focus on nationalist pride.

Never understand how they constantly can go back and forth on shit.. to make it true to them.. so they are right.. regardless of literally video/audio proof, scientific facts, etc.. presented. My favorite is the late night routines where they send someone out to ask people questions.. and throw a bunch of made up shit and you see them right winging MAGA hat wearing dumbasses basically agree that their shit is stupid.. but they don't realize they are doing that.. until you call them out then they turn it in to something else.. so that they aren't wrong.

Biden increased sanctions on Russia after trump tried multiple times to reduce said sanctions (he literally said he believed Russia over his own intelligence agencies and was begging for them to be brought back into global conferences they had been banned from as part of sanctions).

Afghanistan was trump's plan. He literally made said plan with the Taliban at Camp David (on 9/11 no less) without even including the government we supported.

- Is unable to jail his last corrupt leader despite a publicly-admitted plan to prevent voting  
- Has a powerful military around the world (to the point there's a special law agency for militaries)  
- Refuses to follow the International Penal Court  
- Wasn't punished for said use of nukes, despite targetting civilians  
- Where people suffer from lack of medical aid, and children are feeling unsafe at school, to the point locks have to prevent going *into* classrooms, in case an attacker tries to go inside  
- Part of the population claims the government-sanctioned guards are unfairly killing minorities  
- Invaded a country under false pretenses  
- Pardoned people suspected of commiting crimes during the war, and didn't brought them to the IPC  
- Protected the wife of a diplomat after she ran over and killed sombody in a foreign country

No, he did not want out of NATO, that was a threat to try and get them to live up to their spending obligations because it was unfair for the US to continue to carry them.  Now that Russia has reared its ugly head again, and Biden is seen as undependable, Germany is kicking up its spending.

Trump sent missiles to the Ukraine, both Obama and Biden REFUSED to do even after Russia took a piece of the Ukraine earlier on Obama's watch.  Biden finally sent weapons AFTER Russia invaded.

And no Russia did not get Trump elected.  The idea that a few million spent on facebook ads would be enough to overcome the hundreds of millions of dollars more Hillary had in her war chest is laughable,  The collusion was a fiction spun out to help explain why Hillary lost despite having every possible advantage.  She was just that arrogant and that unlikable that even Trump could beat her.  Even CNN finally admitted it was a fiction.

The irony of course is that Hillary actually used a foreign agent which was the false accusation that they hung on Trump.
